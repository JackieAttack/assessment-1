// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, which focuses on determining the precise needs and conditions required by the stakeholders of a project and documenting them."
const design = "The creation of a high level design to determine the conceptual solutions to the problems of a piece of software, often involving things like storyboards."
const implementation = "The lower level actual coding of the solutions determined in the design phase."
const testingAndIntegration = "Testing the software with various pre-planned senarios to ensure it's running as intended, free of bugs, and ensuring any disparate parts are working together without issues."
const maintain = "Identifying any issues after the launch, fixing and ensuring the software continues working with other any other new developments."
